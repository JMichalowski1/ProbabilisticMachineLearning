# Task List 3
## Data manipulation and statistics

### Knowledge & Skills:
- central limit theorem
- correlation
- covariance
- data acquisition
- pandas


### Excercises:
1. (2 p.)Visualize how CLT is observable and depends on number of trials with experiments described by bernoulli and binomial distributions. Explain observations.
2. (3 p.)Acquire two appropriate dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (script within notebook/collaboratory, using pandas for manipulation) and provide exploratory analysis of its content:
- multidimensional scatter plot of attribute pairs (with histograms on axis)
- correlation
- covariances (if appropriate)

Elaborate on results.
