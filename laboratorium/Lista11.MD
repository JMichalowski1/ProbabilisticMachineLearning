# Task List 11
## Hidden Markov models (HMM) - inference

### Knowledge & Skills:

 - HMM
 - Viterbi algorithm

### Exercises:

1. Prepare representation of HMM: (apropriate classes representing states, observations, emission probabilities, transition probabilities)
2. Create one simple HMM model
3. Visualize created model (picture of graph, differend vertices shapes for hidden states, different for observations etc.)
4. Implement method that vill compute most probable state sequence for given ovserved sequence (Viterbi algorithm)



### Remarks
 - Do not repeat yourself, check if the implementation of one task is also the implementation of others,
 - Do not copy your code, create functions and reuse them
 - Use env that will help you solve problems not create new ones in given task
