# Task List 7
## Beta-binomial model

### Knowledge & Skills:
- likelihood
- apriori
- aposteriori
- maximum likelihood estimate
- maximum aposteriori estimate
- online (sequential) and batch learnig

### Exercises:

1. (3p.) Implement a beta-binomial model for coin tossing problem:
    - likelihood as in the lecture
    - prior as in the lecture
    - use binomial, bernoulli and beta from scipy

2. (2p.) Implement a method for posterior predictive distribution of a future observation.
    - appropriate calulation of posterior predictive
    - write example demonstrating prediction
    
3. (3p.) Implement sequential way of updating posterior (online learning):
    - write apropriate methods using Beta distribution
    - demonstrate on chart how posterior evolves with data stream (eg. one by one example)
    - perform online learning experiment with two datasets from UCI data repository
    
### Remarks
 - Do not repeat yourself, check if the implementation of one task is also the implementation of others,
 - Do not copy your code, create functions and reuse them
