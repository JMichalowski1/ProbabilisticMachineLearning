# Task List 9
## Data analysis

### Knowledge & Skills:

 - Data loading
 - Data ploting
 - Corellation calculation
 - Box plot interpretation

### Data:
[https://www.kaggle.com/mknorps/births](https://www.kaggle.com/mknorps/births)

### Exercises:

1. Load data into ANY environment
2. Compute pearson corellation (in python: [scipy.stats.pearsonr](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html))
	- 1 kid vs more kids in years
	- for each region
	- for all regions
3. Plot box plots of data:
	- each region and all regions
	- each year and before 500+ after 500+
4. Analyse plots:
	- what is on box plot? can you help your self somehow in order to do analysis
	- can you see 500+ effect?

    
### Remarks
 - Do not repeat yourself, check if the implementation of one task is also the implementation of others,
 - Do not copy your code, create functions and reuse them
 - Use env that will help you solve problems not create new ones in given task
