## Probability Refresher

### Knowledge:
-  Random variables
-  Rules of Probability for Discrete Variables
-  Marginals and conditional probability
-  PDF - probability density functions
-  CDF: Cumulative Distribution Function
-  Independence, conditional Independence
-  Prior, Likelihood and Posterior

### Excersises:

1.  Write infinite discrete random discrete values generator (integer number from given range, python generators, yield) and visualize how probability of given numbers change in time (matplotlib animation)
2.  Using generator from previous task, visualize probability of occurrence for two consecutive numbers in the stream (matplotlib animation, heatmaps) 
3. TBD
