# Task List 10
## d-separation

### Knowledge & Skills:

 - graphs
 - NetworkX usage
 - d-separation
 - interaction types

### Exercises:

1. Prepare dependency graphs with their visualizations (random directed graphs)
2. Implements method that will show d-separability (tuple for each vertex with boolean infomation about d-separability) for given set of vertices Z
3. Execute d-separability method for random graphs, print vertices witch are d-separable
4. Visualize graphs using d-separability information (different color of d-separable vertices)


### Remarks
 - Do not repeat yourself, check if the implementation of one task is also the implementation of others,
 - Do not copy your code, create functions and reuse them
 - Use env that will help you solve problems not create new ones in given task
